<!-- 
functional components are how components get written nowadays
other React codebases though have a lot of class-based components
prior to Feb 2019, functional components did not have a way to manage state
  hooks were introduced, then components became less verbose and neater


learn structure of a class component and how they are written
  How does JSX get displayed? 
    with render()
how to use props and state in class components
  How do props get used in a class-based component?
    props passed into the component, get passed into the class's constructor
    constructor and super method lets me use the props in the context of this
    this, refers to the component 
    {/* props provided by this instead of as prop passed into a 
        functional component */}
        <h3>{this.props.name}</h3>
  How do I deal with state in a class-based component?
    state gets initialized as a part of the constructor 
uses of this in class components
  How do I restore the context of this in a method?
    /* whenever a method is declared, the this of the method must be
    binded to the this of the class instance
    this way, all methods can access the state and props of the class */
    this.handleInputChange = this.handleInputChange.bind(this);

JS class review
classes - create objects on top of prototype-based inheritance
        readable, is syntactic sugar, and can be overkill for simple use cases
        ideal for complex applications where multiple similar objects and 
        inheritance are required
prototypal inheritance - create objects that inherit from a prototype
                          less familiar syntax, can become complex without structure
                          more approachable for devs familiar with object-oriented paradigms 
                            from other languages 
factory functions - function that returns new objects without using new
                    allows encapsulation and private data using closures,
                    lacks built-in inheritance, shared methods need manual setup
                    ideal for simpler scenarios or when I need more control over
                      object creation (e.g. private properties)
constructor function - create objects using new, reusable for multiple objects
                       supports inheritance, but harder to manage inheritance manually
                       compared to classes
                       less common in modern codebases, classes are more comon
object literals - create a single object using literal notation, not reusable for multiple objects
                  no inheritance
