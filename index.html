<!-- 
functional components are how components get written nowadays
other React codebases though have a lot of class-based components
prior to Feb 2019, functional components did not have a way to manage state
  hooks were introduced, then components became less verbose and neater


learn structure of a class component and how they are written
  How does JSX get displayed?
how to use props and state in class components
  How do props get used in a class-based component?
  How do I deal with state in a class-based component?
uses of this in class components
  How do I restore the context of this in a method?

JS class review
classes - create objects on top of prototype-based inheritance
        readable, is syntactic sugar, and can be overkill for simple use cases
        ideal for complex applications where multiple similar objects and 
        inheritance are required
prototypal inheritance - create objects that inherit from a prototype
                          less familiar syntax, can become complex without structure
                          more approachable for devs familiar with object-oriented paradigms 
                            from other languages 
factory functions - function that returns new objects without using new
                    allows encapsulation and private data using closures,
                    lacks built-in inheritance, shared methods need manual setup
                    ideal for simpler scenarios or when I need more control over
                      object creation (e.g. private properties)
constructor function - create objects using new, reusable for multiple objects
                       supports inheritance, but harder to manage inheritance manually
                       compared to classes
                       less common in modern codebases, classes are more comon
object literals - create a single object using literal notation, not reusable for multiple objects
                  no inheritance
